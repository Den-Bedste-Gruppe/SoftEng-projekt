# 02161 - Software Engineering 2021 - Group 7 Project

Project is based on Java 11.

## Run Instructions

### General:

Run the `main()` method in the `Main` class of the `dtu.ui` package.

### Eclipse:

"Run project" in `Main` class in the `dtu.ui` package

NB: Clearing the screen fails in the built-in terminal on Eclipse.
This does not break the program, but does make the UI cluttered and confusing.

## Automated Tests

### Eclipse:

Install a Cucumber runner plugin, run tests as JUnit tests.

### Maven:

Run `mvn test`.
